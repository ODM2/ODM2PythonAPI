## Documentation

For the latest documentation of the ODM2 Python API, see [http://odm2.github.io/ODM2PythonAPI/](http://odm2.github.io/ODM2PythonAPI/)

## Installation

The easiest and most reliable way to install the ODM2 Python API (`odm2api`) is using the
[Conda package management system](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/)
via either
[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
or
[Miniconda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html).
To start using conda (if it's not your system default),
add conda to the PATH; on MacOSX and Linux,
it's something like `export PATH=$HOME/miniconda/bin:$PATH`,
but the exact path may vary.

To activate a conda environment, say, "myenv":

```bash
activate myenv  # On Windows
source activate myenv  # On MacOSX or Linux
```

**Note:** `odm2api` currently is only tested on Python 2.7. Some changes have been made to support Python 3.x,
but they haven't been tested thoroughly.


### Latest release, from ODM2 anaconda.org channel

The
[latest `odm2api` release](https://github.com/ODM2/ODM2PythonAPI/releases)
is available on the
[ODM2 anaconda.org channel](https://anaconda.org/odm2/odm2api)
for all major OS paltforms (linux, OSX, win32/win64).
To install it on an existing conda environment:

```
conda install -c odm2 odm2api
```

All dependencies are installed,
including Pandas and its dependencies (numpy, etc).

To create a new environment "myenv" with the `odm2api` package:

```
conda create -n myenv -c odm2 python=2.7 odm2api
```

### Installing the development version from the `master` branch on github

**Note from 4/26/2016:** These instructions may be slightly outdated.
Follow these directions for installing the bleeding edge GitHub master branch,
mainly for development and testing purposes.

To create a new environment "myenv" with `odm2api`,
first download the conda environment file
[condaenvironment_1.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ODM2/ODM2PythonAPI/master/condaenvironment_1.yml).
Go to the directory where `condaenvironment_1.yml` was downloaded.
Then, on a terminal shell:

```bash
conda env create -n myenv --file py2_conda_environment.yml
```

Activate the new environment, then install `odm2api` into the environment:

```bash
activate myenv  # On Windows
source activate myenv  # On MacOSX or Linux

pip install --process-dependency-links git+https://github.com/ODM2/ODM2PythonAPI.git
```
